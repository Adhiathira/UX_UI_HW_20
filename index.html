        <div class="Subheading">
            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>The case study is about redesign and update a Government Agency website. I choose United States
                Department of Agriculture as it servers millions of Americans every year. During my research I found
                that it covers 29 agencies. The goal of the redesign was to increase the usability and help all the
                USDA’s different users find information successfully and quickly.</p>

        <div class="Subheading">
            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>The USDA website currently suffers from inadequate responsive web design standards, resulting in a
                lackluster aesthetic appeal. Additionally, its navigation structure is poorly organized, leading to
                user confusion and challenges in locating desired information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Subheading">
            <h3>The Solution:</h3>
            <p>Given the extensive scope of the website, I initiated the redesign process beginning with the
                homepage. To enhance user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms, I focused on streamlining
                navigation and reorganizing the site’s hierarchy. This strategic restructuring was aimed at
                facilitating easier navigation and enabling users to find information more efficiently.</p>

    <div class="subheading2">
        <h2> Where to begin? </h2>
    </div>

    <div class="Subheading1">
        <h3>User Research </h3>
        <p>We knew we had to redesign the site so there were less steps to get to the most visited pages. After
            evaluating the website we created a proto persona for whom we were redesigning this website for.We felt
            that the user should be someone who often visits the websites.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="Subheading">
            <h3>Proto persona</h3>
            <p>Our User jasmine visits USDA website because she needs to find specific information about loans and
                grants to invest in her business.</p>
        </div>
        <img src="./images/proto.png" width="490" height="420">

    <div class="Subheading1">
        <h3>Defined User Flow</h3>
        <p>My user path: A women and/or person of color who is looking for the options available in loan and grant
            section, so they can invest in their farming business. They want to know the types of loans and interest
            rates are available.</p>


        <p> In order to understand what to redesign I had to know what links and pages users interacted to reach the
            Farm Loan Page. When reviewed the flow I could see the user can reach “Farm Loan Page” by multiple
            paths.</p>


        <img src="./images/define.png" width="500" height="420">


        <p>Since there are multiple path to reach the “Minority and Women Farmers and Ranchers loan page ” I believe the
            ideal path would be to follow through the Navigation bar in the home page and the easy path will be by
            scrolling down in the home page and having a option to taking the shortcut.</p>

    <div class="Subheading1">
        <h3>Heuristic evaluation</h3>
        <p>In order to check what usability issues they ran into, I had conducted a heuristic analysis to rate the
            problems in the evaluation file.</p>
        <p>Evaluation File: <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Pvg3Bn4IV3iBMb4-f8NF_O7f0Rd28KktHIoQa36bydM/edit#gid=0">

            <li class="list-group-item">The looks of the site was very basic blue and white.</li>

        <h3>Color Accessibility Test</h3>
        <p>The website have pretty basic colors in order to check the color contract and AAA and AA Test I conducted
            color accessibility test.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="Subheading1">
        <h3>Usability Test</h3>
        <p>To validate our analysis, we conducted two usability tests. Initially, we formulated a testing plan to
            understand user interactions with the existing USDA website. Subsequently, we enlisted willing participants
            and carried out a total of five tests..</p>

        <h3>Below is the test objective:</h3>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">To find if the users are able to find grants and loan information easily in the
                website.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">To find out what improvements users needs and wanted to be included in the
                website.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">To find out how intuitive the existing site is for the users and if they get
                stuck while performing certain
                tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> </p>
        <p> Second we exclusively concentrated on evaluating the website navigation, specifically the header and footer
            sections. Our testing involved two assessments on desktop platforms and an additional two tests conducted on
            mobile phones. Given the absence of a dedicated mobile app for the USDA, we assessed the website’s
            performance on mobile screens to ensure comprehensive coverage.In the testing plan I had requested to find
            details about the loans and grant page by using only the nav bar and the users were confused since it took
            them to 2 different home pages.</p>
