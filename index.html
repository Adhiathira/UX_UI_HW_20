    <div class="section">
        <div class="Subheading">
            <h3>Overview:</h3>
            <p>The case study is about redesign and update a Government Agency website. I choose United States
                Department of Agriculture as it servers millions of Americans every year. During my research I found
                that it covers 29 agencies. The goal of the redesign was to increase the usability and help all the
                USDA’s different users find information successfully and quickly.</p>
        </div>

        <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/DielFyVblHHtvczkar9oKo/Personal-USDA-GOV?page-id=311%3A545&type=design&node-id=311-546&viewport=532%2C474%2C0.03&t=mft9QWamfLiqNsiM-1&scaling=min-zoom&starting-point-node-id=311%3A546&mode=design"

            <h3>The Problem:</h3>
            <p>The USDA website currently suffers from inadequate responsive web design standards, resulting in a
                lackluster aesthetic appeal. Additionally, its navigation structure is poorly organized, leading to
                user confusion and challenges in locating desired information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="Subheading">
            <h3>The Solution:</h3>
            <p>Given the extensive scope of the website, I initiated the redesign process beginning with the
                homepage. To enhance user experience on both desktop and mobile platforms, I focused on streamlining
                navigation and reorganizing the site’s hierarchy. This strategic restructuring was aimed at
                facilitating easier navigation and enabling users to find information more efficiently.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="Subheading1">
        <h3>User Research </h3>
        <p>We knew we had to redesign the site so there were less steps to get to the most visited pages. After
            evaluating the website we created a proto persona for whom we were redesigning this website for.We felt
            that the user should be someone who often visits the websites.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <div class="Subheading">
            <h3>Proto persona</h3>
            <p>Our User jasmine visits USDA website because she needs to find specific information about loans and
                grants to invest in her business.</p>

        <p>My user path: A women and/or person of color who is looking for the options available in loan and grant
            section, so they can invest in their farming business. They want to know the types of loans and interest
            rates are available.</p>


        <p> In order to understand what to redesign I had to know what links and pages users interacted to reach the
            Farm Loan Page. When reviewed the flow I could see the user can reach “Farm Loan Page” by multiple
            paths.</p>


        <img src="./images/define.png" width="500" height="420">


        <p>Since there are multiple path to reach the “Minority and Women Farmers and Ranchers loan page ” I believe the
            ideal path would be to follow through the Navigation bar in the home page and the easy path will be by
            scrolling down in the home page and having a option to taking the shortcut.</p>

    <div class="Subheading1">
        <h3>Usability Test</h3>
        <p>To validate our analysis, we conducted two usability tests. Initially, we formulated a testing plan to
            understand user interactions with the existing USDA website. Subsequently, we enlisted willing participants
            and carried out a total of five tests..</p>

        <h3>Below is the test objective:</h3>
        <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">To find if the users are able to find grants and loan information easily in the
                website.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">To find out what improvements users needs and wanted to be included in the
                website.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">To find out how intuitive the existing site is for the users and if they get
                stuck while performing certain
                tasks.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> </p>
        <p> Second we exclusively concentrated on evaluating the website navigation, specifically the header and footer
            sections. Our testing involved two assessments on desktop platforms and an additional two tests conducted on
            mobile phones. Given the absence of a dedicated mobile app for the USDA, we assessed the website’s
            performance on mobile screens to ensure comprehensive coverage.In the testing plan I had requested to find
            details about the loans and grant page by using only the nav bar and the users were confused since it took
            them to 2 different home pages.</p>

        <h3>Findings and Results</h3>
        <p>The user were confused and were not sure how to reach the designation, one of my user used the search bar to
            find the details.Most of the users are not interested in how the website or mobile version looks as long as
            they are able to find the information easily and efficiently.</p>

            available on the USDA website.By grouping information together, I was able to find a lot of redundancy. The
            site highlighted content which I felt is not important to the users. I noted down the primary, secondary

            <h3>New Navigation Prototype</h3>
            <p>Following the user research, I identified the home page navigation bar as the most crucial element.
                Concentrating on the header, footer, and navigation bar, I implemented a hovering function and
                introduced a
                drop-down menu in the navigation bar, aligning it with the previously established site map.
                Additionally, I
                incorporated a hovering function in the footer to emphasize the highlighted item upon hovering.</p>

        <p>Before I start with the new wireframe in Figma I sketched the layout for all the 5 screens I was redesigning
            which helped me in my wireframing process.</p>
        <p>In this phase, I undertook a redesign of the header navigation bar, aiming to make improvements from the
            initial iteration. I developed distinct components for each dropdown navigation, including various forms. To
            streamline the user experience, I opted for a consolidated frame instead of incorporating multiple dropdowns
            and sub-dropdowns. This approach enables users to view all the details at once, minimizing the need for
            multiple clicks.In this stage I also concentrated on the user’s navigation journey, sketching out the
            website layout based on the intended path. Prioritizing user guidance, I organized the page content to
            facilitate seamless navigation. While maintaining the effectiveness of certain original website design
            patterns, I made refinements to enhance the overall layout.</p>

            <h3>UI Style Guide</h3>
            <p>I Started with the development of a UI Style Tile, I expanded it by adding UI components that are
                consistently applied across both the website and mobile application redesign. Recognizing the need for
                an aesthetic overhaul from the old website, I opted for colors that reflect an agricultural backdrop.The
                chosen primary and secondary colors impart a warm and bright visual appeal to the website. While
                retaining attractive elements from the old design, I even updated logo to align with the new aesthetic.
                Crucially, I ensured that the primary colors adhere to both AA and AAA accessibility standards for an
                inclusive design.</p>

        <h3>Usability Test </h3>
        <p>I conducted usability test for all the 3 models but since the mobile version wasn’t tested earlier I focused
            more on it.I created a Usability test Plan Dashboard which included details like test task and business case
            etc. The Testing Doc has the feedback received from each users updated.</p>
        <img src="./images/dashboard report.png" width="1500" height="620">

        <p>While performing the testing I also tried out the AB testing by creating 2 screens for the home page with
            different way to present the footer details.In screen 1 I had presented the footer details and in the screen
            2 the footer details were hide under the hamburger bar.Turns out I was using the progressive testing method
            instead of AB testing. The test helped me find out which needs to be included in the screen.</p>

    <div class="Subheading1">
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>I was really excited because it was my first high-fidelity project. But when I started with the research of
            the USDA website, I was a bit worried because it’s so huge. I had to look at it multiple times to figure out
            the problems users might face and come up with solutions. Every time I sketched my wireframe, I had to go
            back several times to make sure I didn’t miss anything important from the actual website.
            I found Information Architecture challenging due to the abundance of data, requiring me to distill and
            condense information effectively. I engaged in multiple card sorting sessions, meticulously categorizing
            details before finally crafting the site map.
            In the future I would like to work more on the responsiveness of the website as I am still learning features
            and characteristics of Auto layout in Figma.
            As always usability testing help me find so many issues which I hadn’t noticed earlier. Due to time
            constraints I couldn’t make a lot of changes but I would love to make it better.</p>
